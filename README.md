# üîç Bias Detection in Text

Welcome to [Ethical Spectacle Research](https:/ethicalspectacle.org)'s founding project!!

---

On September 23, 2024 we'll publish:

- **Our ArXiv paper:** GUS-NET (Generalizations Unfairness and Stereotypes Network).
- **Named Entity Recognition Model:** BERT for multi-label multi-class classification of tokens.
- **Binary Classification:** BERT for binary classification, using token sequence and NER tags.
- **Model Training ipynb's:** The pytorch training pipelines used to train our models.
- **Synthetic Data ipynb's:** We took a synthetic data approach to our training, we'll publish the notebooks here for you to build your own annotated datasets.

That weekend, our research group will host a [hackathon](https://ethicalspectacle.org/hackathon?id=8) to offically launch this open source project and see what the world builds with it.

In the meantime, you should check out this [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-bert-social-bias-classification-maximus-powers-lv1ee/?trackingId=jg4q3vS1QwKO0vY%2B%2BKA2dw%3D%3Dx) about how BERT can be used for binary classification. We build on these concepts in our research paper.
